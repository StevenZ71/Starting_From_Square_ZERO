# Starting_From_Square_ZERO
Starting From Square ZERO is a 2D top-down fighting and story game made using Java and Intellij. Link for unfinished Java version is at https://stuuop.itch.io/starting-from-square-zero-demosneak-peek.
## How to play
Use arrow keys and wasd to navigate the starting menu. Press X to select an option. The gameplay controls itself are in the "How to play" section.
## Note
The game has been moved to Unity, so the Java version will get no more updates. The commits you see here are done all at once because one of my commits in my last repository with this game in it accidentally contained information that would spoil the plot (I had an idea file where I would put the ideas I had for the story).
